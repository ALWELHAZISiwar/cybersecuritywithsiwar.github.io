## Key Aspects of CSRF 🔑

| **Aspect**               | **Details**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | A type of security vulnerability that tricks a user into unknowingly performing actions on a web application where they are authenticated. 🤖 |
| **How it Works**          | 1. Victim logs in to a web application. 🔐 <br> 2. Attacker sends a malicious link or form. ⚠️ <br> 3. Victim clicks the link or visits the site, unknowingly executing the action with their credentials. 🖱️ |
| **Common Targets**        | Web applications with user authentication, such as banking sites 💳, social networks 🌐, e-commerce platforms 🛒. |
| **Attack Example**        | A malicious form that submits a transfer request to a banking site, transferring money from the victim’s account to the attacker’s. 💸 |
| **Consequences**          | Unauthorized actions 🚨, data theft 🔓, financial loss 💰, privilege escalation ⬆️, and system compromise ⚠️. |
| **Prevention Methods**    | 1. **CSRF Tokens**: Unique tokens in forms that are verified by the server. 🔑 <br> 2. **SameSite Cookies**: Prevents cookies from being sent in cross-origin requests. 🍪 <br> 3. **Custom HTTP Headers**: Use headers like `X-Requested-With` for AJAX requests. 📡 <br> 4. **Double Submit Cookies**: Tokens sent both as a cookie and in the request body. 🔄 |
| **Real-World Examples**   | 1. **PayPal CSRF Vulnerability (2007)**: Attacker could trick a victim into making unauthorized payments. 💳💥 <br> 2. **WordPress CSRF Vulnerability (2010)**: Attackers could change user credentials and publish posts without authorization. 📝🔒 |
| **Mitigation Techniques** | 1. Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests. 🛡️ <br> 2. Use SameSite cookies for improved cookie security. 🍪🔐 <br> 3. Educate users on phishing and suspicious links. 🎓 |
